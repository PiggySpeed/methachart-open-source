# MethaChart
MethaChart is an application that helps pharmacies reliable build methadone log forms. It is a
simple and lightweight system that achieves the following goals:
1. Safe administration of methadone
2. Reduced documentation burden

## Dates
All Dates must be represented either in the form 'MMM DD, YYYY' or 'MM DD YYYY'. This is 
intentional. This ensures that the user doesn't misread 'Jan 1 2016' as 'Jan 12, 2016' or make
stray pen marks on 'Jan 1, 2016' to make it look like 'Jan 11, 2016'. The leading zero is
important and should stay there.
;tldr
BAD: 'Jan 1, 2016',
GOOD: 'Jan 01, 2016'

This application accounts for leap years.
